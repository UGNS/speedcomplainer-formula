        - Hey {tweetTo} I'm paying for {internetSpeed}Mb/s but getting only {downloadResult} Mb/s?!? Shame.
        - Oi! {tweetTo} $100+/month for {internetSpeed}Mbit/s and I only get {downloadResult} Mbit/s? How does that seem fair?

        - Uhh {tweetTo} for $100+/month I expect better than {downloadResult}Mbit/s when I'm paying for {internetSpeed}Mbit/s. Fix your network!
        - Hey {tweetTo} why am I only getting {downloadResult}Mb/s when I pay for {internetSpeed}Mb/s? $100+/month for this??
      25:
        - Well {tweetTo} I guess {downloadResult}Mb/s is better than nothing, still not worth $100/mnth when I expect {internetSpeed}Mb/s
